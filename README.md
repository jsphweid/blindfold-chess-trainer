# blindfold-chess-js
The point of this project is to use the technologies of our day (speech recognition / synthesis) to promote a style of chess playing involving only the mind / memory and making that promotion easily accessible to everyone.

MVP
~~- computer uses random moves (no AI) with text commands~~

~~Phase 1: text commands~~

~~Phase 2: voice commands~~

Phase 3: ai

(Phase 4: peer to peer)

TODO:
 - when piece goes to other side, figure out how to revive older pieces
 - ending game should do something more special
 - should refocus on hit enter...
 - get as far as possible with UI before someone else can add to it
  - 'play random game' and "load from fen" and "hide board" and 'show possible moves' should be under 'advanced'
  - simplify -> input box or hit spacebar
