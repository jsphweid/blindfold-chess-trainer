# blindfold-chess-js
The point of this project is to use the technologies of our day (speech recognition / synthesis) to promote a style of chess playing involving only the mind / memory and making that promotion easily accessible to everyone.

MVP
~~- computer uses random moves (no AI) with text commands~~

~~Phase 1: text commands~~

~~Phase 2: voice commands~~

Phase 3: ai

(Phase 4: peer to peer)

TODO:

Stuff for someone else to do?
 - ending game should do something more special
 - colors / styles / spacings
 - mobile? => spacebar won't really work
  - should refocus on hit enter...

Stuff to mix maybe one day:
 - reloading from a black turn should make black go immediately (else it never will)
