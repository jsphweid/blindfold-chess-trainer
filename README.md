# blindfold-chess-js
The point of this project is to use the technologies of our day (speech recognition / synthesis) to promote a style of chess playing involving only the mind / memory and making that promotion easily accessible to everyone.

MVP
~~- computer uses random moves (no AI) with text commands~~

~~Phase 1: text commands~~

~~Phase 2: voice commands~~

Phase 3: ai

(Phase 4: peer to peer)

TODO:

Stuff for someone else to do? (top priority at the top)
 - a better plan for organizing content
  - ideally you won't need to scroll on desktop or mobile except to see the brief instructions / about section.
  - should be intuitive so you can just start using...
 - colors / spacings / styles in general
 - the main button should do some special cool artistic thing when it is talking (and probably when you are holding it down too???)
 - ending game should do something more special... a modal pops up?

Stuff to mix maybe one day:
 - reloading from a black turn should make black go immediately (else it never will)
